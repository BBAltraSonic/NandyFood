enum DeliveryMethod { delivery, pickup }
enum PaymentMethod { cash, card }
```

**Extended CartState:**
- `deliveryMethod` - Current delivery method (default: delivery)
- `selectedAddress` - Selected Address object for delivery
- `deliveryNotes` - Optional delivery instructions
- `paymentMethod` - Payment type (default: cash)
- `restaurantId` - Associated restaurant ID

**New Methods:**

### 5. Modernized Checkout Screen âœ…
**File:** `lib/features/order/presentation/screens/checkout_screen.dart`

  if (cartState.isLoading || cartState.items.isEmpty) return false;
  
  // For delivery, must have selected address
  if (cartState.deliveryMethod == DeliveryMethod.delivery &&
      cartState.selectedAddress == null) {
    return false;
  }
  
  return true;
}
```

**Dynamic Button Text:**
- "Cart is Empty" - When no items

- "Place Order (Cash on Pickup)" - Ready to place pickup order

**User Experience Improvements:**
- Clear validation feedback
- Disabled states with explanatory text
- Loading indicators during async operations
- Automatic address loading on screen mount

### 6. Database Migration âœ…
**Migration:** `add_delivery_method_to_orders`

**Schema Changes:**
```sql
-- Add delivery_method column
ALTER TABLE orders
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS delivery_method TEXT 
DEFAULT 'delivery' 
CHECK (delivery_method IN ('delivery', 'pickup'));

-- Add delivery_notes column
ALTER TABLE orders
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS delivery_notes TEXT;

-- Add payment_method column
ALTER TABLE orders
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS payment_method TEXT 
DEFAULT 'cash' 
CHECK (payment_method IN ('cash', 'card'));

-- Update existing orders with default values
UPDATE orders
SET delivery_method = 'delivery', payment_method = 'cash'
WHERE delivery_method IS NULL OR payment_method IS NULL;
```

**Benefits:**
- Type-safe delivery method storage
- Support for future payment methods
- Optional delivery notes field
- Backward compatible with existing orders

## ðŸ“ž Questions & Support

### Common Questions:

**Q: Why cash only?**  
A: Per user request to simplify initial implementation and focus on core checkout flow without payment gateway complexity.

**Q: How do I add card payments later?**  
A: The infrastructure is already in place with the `PaymentMethod` enum. Just add a new widget similar to `PaymentMethodSelectorCash` that handles card input.

**Q: Can users skip address selection for pickup?**  
A: Yes! The address selector automatically hides for pickup orders, and validation doesn't require an address.

**Q: What happens to delivery fee for pickup?**  
A: It's automatically set to $0.00 when pickup is selected.

**Q: Are delivery notes required?**  
A: No, they're optional. The field clearly indicates "Optional" in the label.
