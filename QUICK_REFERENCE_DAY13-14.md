// New fields
final DeliveryMethod deliveryMethod;
final Address? selectedAddress;
final String? deliveryNotes;
final PaymentMethod paymentMethod;
final String? restaurantId;

// New methods
setDeliveryMethod(DeliveryMethod method)
setSelectedAddress(Address? address)
setDeliveryNotes(String? notes)
setPaymentMethod(PaymentMethod method)
setRestaurantId(String? restaurantId)
```

### Checkout Screen

---

## 💡 How to Use

### For Users:
1. **Open Checkout** → See delivery/pickup options
2. **Select Method** → Choose delivery or pickup
3. **For Delivery:** Select address and add notes (optional)
4. **For Pickup:** Just review order (no address needed)
5. **Review Total** → Delivery fee only shows for delivery
6. **Place Order** → Pay cash on delivery/pickup

### For Developers:

**Check delivery method:**
```dart
final cartState = ref.watch(cartProvider);
if (cartState.deliveryMethod == DeliveryMethod.delivery) {
  // Show delivery-specific UI
}
```

**Set delivery address:**
```dart
final cartNotifier = ref.read(cartProvider.notifier);
cartNotifier.setSelectedAddress(selectedAddress);
```

**Add delivery notes:**
```dart
cartNotifier.setDeliveryNotes("Ring doorbell");
```

---

## ✅ Validation Rules

- **Pickup orders:** No address required
- **Delivery orders:** Must have selected address
- **All orders:** Must have items in cart
- **Payment:** Always cash (no validation needed)

---

## 🎨 UI Components

### Delivery Method Cards
- **Icons:** `delivery_dining`, `store`
- **Colors:** Primary color for selected, surface for unselected
- **Animation:** 200ms smooth transition

### Address Cards
- **Sections:** Type, street, city/state/zip, instructions
- **Badges:** Default address badge
- **Actions:** Edit button, tap to select

### Empty State
- **Icon:** `location_off_outlined`

## 🔄 State Flow

```

  ↓
Addresses Load
  ↓

## 📊 Delivery Fee Logic

```dart
// Delivery selected → Fee applies
deliveryMethod = DeliveryMethod.delivery
deliveryFee = $2.99

// Pickup selected → Fee removed
deliveryMethod = DeliveryMethod.pickup
deliveryFee = $0.00

// Switching back to delivery → Fee restored
deliveryMethod = DeliveryMethod.delivery
deliveryFee = $2.99 (if was 0)
```
