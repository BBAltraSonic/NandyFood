## Executive Summary

The NandyFood project is a food delivery application built with Flutter and Supabase backend. After thorough analysis, the project demonstrates a solid technical foundation but has critical gaps in user experience, payment integration, and real-time features. This document provides a complete analysis of the current state and a comprehensive step-by-step plan to reach full completion with priority on UX and security.

**Key Findings:**
- Strong technical foundation with 14+ database migrations
