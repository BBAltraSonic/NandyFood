## Testing Strategy

### Test Pyramid Implementation
- **Unit Tests**: 70% of tests covering business logic and services
- **Widget Tests**: 20% of tests covering UI components
- **Integration Tests**: 10% of tests covering critical user flows

### Test Coverage Goals
- **Business Logic**: >80% coverage
- **UI Components**: >70% coverage
- **Critical Flows**: 100% coverage
- **Error Handling**: 100% coverage
- **Edge Cases**: >90% coverage

### Test Organization
- **By Feature**: Tests organized by feature modules
- **By Type**: Tests separated by unit, widget, and integration
- **By Component**: Tests grouped by specific components
- **By Flow**: Integration tests organized by user flows
