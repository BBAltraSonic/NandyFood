## Testing Principles Applied

### 1. End-to-End Flow Verification
- Each test verifies complete user journeys
- Multiple components are tested together
- Data flows between services are validated
- State transitions are properly verified

### 2. Realistic Data Handling
- Tests use realistic data structures
- Mock data represents real-world scenarios
- Edge cases and error conditions are covered
- Data validation is thoroughly tested

### 3. Service Integration
- Different services work together correctly
- Data consistency across services is verified
- Error propagation between services is tested
- Performance characteristics are validated

### 4. State Management
- Application state is properly maintained
- State transitions are smooth and correct
- Concurrent operations are handled properly
- Cleanup and teardown are comprehensive
