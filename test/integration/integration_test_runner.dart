///
/// To run individual test files:
/// flutter test test/integration/auth_flow_integration_test.dart
/// flutter test test/integration/order_flow_integration_test.dart
/// flutter test test/integration/restaurant_owner_flow_integration_test.dart

/// Test Configuration and Guidelines
///
/// 1. Setup:
///    - Ensure all environment variables are set in .env file
///    - Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
///    - Run `dart run build_runner build` to generate required files
///
/// 2. Running Tests:
///    - All tests: `flutter test test/integration/`
///    - Specific file: `flutter test test/integration/<filename>.dart`
///    - With coverage: `flutter test --coverage test/integration/`
///
/// 3. Test Environment:
///    - Tests run in development environment
///    - Database connections are mocked where possible
///    - External API calls are simulated
///
/// 4. Coverage Areas:
///    - ✅ Authentication flows (login, signup, logout)
///    - ✅ Order flows (cart, checkout, customization)
///    - ✅ Restaurant owner dashboard and analytics
///    - ✅ Payment integration (cash, PayFast)
///    - ✅ Role-based access control
///    - ✅ Error handling and validation
///    - ✅ Navigation and routing
///    - ✅ State management
///
/// 5. Best Practices:
///    - Each test should be independent
///    - Use proper setUp and tearDown
///    - Mock external dependencies
///    - Test both positive and negative scenarios
///    - Verify UI states and user interactions
///    - Include proper assertions and error handling
