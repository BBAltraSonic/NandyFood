## Testing Principles Applied

### 1. Comprehensive Coverage
- Each screen has tests for display validation
- User interactions are thoroughly tested
- Navigation flows are verified
- Edge cases and error states are covered

### 2. State Management
- Tests verify correct behavior in different states (loading, empty, error)
- State transitions are properly validated
- Mock data is used to simulate different scenarios

### 3. User Experience
- Tests ensure intuitive UI/UX
- Form validation is thoroughly checked
- Accessibility considerations are included
- Responsive design is verified

### 4. Integration Points
- Navigation between screens is tested
- External service integrations are mocked
- Data flow between components is validated

## Test Organization

### Directory Structure
```
test/
└── widget/
    └── screens/
        ├── login_screen_test.dart
        ├── signup_screen_test.dart
        ├── home_screen_test.dart
        ├── restaurant_list_screen_test.dart
        ├── restaurant_detail_screen_test.dart
        ├── menu_screen_test.dart
        ├── cart_screen_test.dart
        ├── checkout_screen_test.dart
        ├── order_tracking_screen_test.dart
        └── profile_screen_test.dart
```

### Test Grouping
- Tests are organized by screen/component
- Related functionality is grouped within each test file
- Common setup and teardown logic is centralized
- Reusable test utilities are implemented where appropriate

## Quality Assurance

### Test Reliability
- Tests are deterministic and repeatable
- Proper setup and teardown for each test
- Isolated test environments
- Consistent test results

### Performance
- Tests execute efficiently without unnecessary delays
- Mock services used to avoid real network calls
- Proper cleanup after each test
- Minimal resource usage during testing

### Maintainability
- Tests follow consistent naming conventions
- Clear separation of test setup, execution, and verification
- Descriptive test names that explain expected behavior
- Well-structured test files that are easy to navigate

## Future Improvements

### Test Expansion
1. Add more edge case testing
2. Implement accessibility testing
