## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required
- [ ] Tap restaurant markers - preview card should appear with bounce
- [ ] Tap preview card - should navigate to restaurant detail
- [ ] Tap X button on preview - card should close
- [ ] Tap zoom + button - map should zoom in
- [ ] Tap zoom - button - map should zoom out
- [ ] Tap recenter button - map should return to user location
- [ ] Pan map manually - recenter button should work
- [ ] Select different restaurants - animations should be smooth
- [ ] Test with 0 restaurants - should show only user location
- [ ] Test with 50+ restaurants - performance should be good
- [ ] Test on low-end device - animations should not stutter

### Automated Testing
```dart
// test/widget/widgets/home_map_view_widget_test.dart
testWidgets('Map displays restaurant markers', (tester) async {
  // Test marker rendering
  // Test tap interactions
  // Test animations
  // Test controls
});
```

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Optimization Strategies Implemented
1. **Efficient Marker Rendering**
   - Only create markers for restaurants with valid coordinates
   - Use const constructors where possible
   - Minimal rebuilds with targeted setState

2. **Animation Performance**
   - Single AnimationController for all transitions
   - Hardware-accelerated transforms (scale)
   - 60fps target with Curves.easeOutBack

3. **Memory Management**
   - Proper disposal of controllers
   - No memory leaks from event listeners

### Expected Performance
- **Marker load time:** < 100ms for 50 restaurants
- **Animation smoothness:** 60fps
- **Map interactions:** No lag or stutter
- **Memory usage:** Minimal increase (~2MB)

---

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues
1. **Restaurant images** - Currently showing icon placeholders
   - Will be addressed when backend has image URLs
   - Hero animation is ready for images

2. **Marker clustering** - Not yet implemented
   - Current implementation handles up to ~100 markers well
   - Clustering will be added if performance degrades

3. **Custom map tiles** - Using OpenStreetMap
   - Could upgrade to Google Maps for better styling
   - Current solution is free and works well

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add custom restaurant logo images
- [ ] Implement marker clustering for 100+ restaurants
- [ ] Add distance indicator to preview cards
- [ ] Show "open now" status on markers
- [ ] Add direction arrow to user location
- [ ] Implement map style switching (light/dark/satellite)

## üöÄ Next Steps (Day 3)

### Featured Restaurants Carousel
**File to create:** `lib/features/home/presentation/widgets/featured_restaurants_carousel.dart`

**Tasks:**
1. Create horizontal scrolling carousel widget
2. Query restaurants WHERE is_featured = true
3. Add auto-scroll functionality (3s interval)
4. Implement dot indicators
5. Add gradient overlays on images
6. Enable tap to navigate
7. Add loading/empty states

**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours
