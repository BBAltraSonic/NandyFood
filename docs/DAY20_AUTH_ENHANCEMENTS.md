class HomeScreen extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Column(
        children: [
          const EmailVerificationBanner(), // Add this
          // ... rest of home screen
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Checking Verification Status
```dart
final isVerified = ref.read(authStateProvider.notifier).isEmailVerified;

if (!isVerified) {
  // Show warning or redirect
}
```

### Programmatic Password Reset
```dart
await ref.read(authStateProvider.notifier).sendPasswordResetEmail(
  email: 'user@example.com',
  redirectTo: 'https://yourapp.com/reset', // optional
);

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Email Delivery Dependency**
   - Relies on Supabase email delivery
   - No guarantee of delivery (spam folders, blocks, etc.)
   - No retry logic for failed sends

2. **Client-Side Rate Limiting**
   - 60s cooldown is client-side only
   - Determined user could bypass via DevTools
   - Should be supplemented with server-side rate limiting

3. **No Email Editing**
   - Once account created, can't easily change email
   - Would need additional feature for email updates

4. **Banner Persistence**
   - Banner relies on current session state
   - Doesn't persist across app restarts
   - Re-checks on each build

## 📝 Developer Notes

### Supabase Configuration Required
Ensure Supabase project has:
- Email auth enabled
- Email templates configured
- SMTP settings configured (or use Supabase default)
- Appropriate redirect URLs whitelisted

### Environment Variables
No additional env vars required. Uses existing Supabase configuration.

### Testing Considerations
- Tests require mocked Supabase client for full coverage
- Email delivery can't be tested in unit tests
- Manual testing recommended for email flows
- Use Supabase dev environment for testing

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Emails not received  
**Solution:** Check spam folder, verify Supabase SMTP config, check email provider blocks

**Issue:** "Email already exists" on signup  
**Solution:** This is handled by existing signup flow

**Issue:** Cooldown timer not working  
**Solution:** Ensure Timer is properly disposed, check state updates
