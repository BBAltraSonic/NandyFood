- ✅ Speed-based calculation with 1.2x traffic factor
- ✅ Periodic updates every 30 seconds
- ✅ Minimum speed threshold (10 km/h) for realistic ETAs
- ✅ Color-coded ETA banner:
  - Green: ≤ 5 minutes ("Arriving very soon!")

  - Blue: > 15 minutes ("On the way")

### 4. Driver Contact Features
- ✅ Driver information card with photo and rating
- ✅ Vehicle type and number display
- ✅ "Call Driver" button (launches phone dialer via `tel:` URI)

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### State Management
```
Riverpod Provider Family
└── DriverLocationNotifier
    ├── Subscribes to Supabase Realtime
    ├── Manages location state
    ├── Calculates ETA, speed, heading
    └── Handles reconnection logic
```

### Widget Hierarchy
```
EnhancedOrderTrackingScreen
├── Order Header Card
├── Live Tracking Map (conditional)
├── ETA Banner (conditional)
├── Driver Info Card (conditional)
├── Order Status Timeline
└── Delivery Address Card
```

## 🗄️ Database Schema Requirements

### New Table Required: `driver_locations`
```sql
CREATE TABLE driver_locations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  driver_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES drivers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  latitude DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
  longitude DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
  speed DOUBLE PRECISION,
  heading DOUBLE PRECISION,
  accuracy DOUBLE PRECISION,
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable RLS and Realtime
ALTER TABLE driver_locations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE driver_locations;
```

### Enhanced `deliveries` Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE deliveries
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS driver_name VARCHAR(255),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS driver_phone VARCHAR(50),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS driver_rating DECIMAL(3,2),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS driver_photo_url TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS vehicle_type VARCHAR(50),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS vehicle_number VARCHAR(50);
```

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- ✅ Users can only view location of their order's driver
- ✅ Driver ID verified against active orders
- ✅ Status check: only active delivery orders

### Privacy
- ✅ Phone numbers sanitized before URI creation
- ✅ Driver location only shown during active delivery
- ✅ Location data timestamped for auditing

---

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Before Deploying to Production
- [ ] Execute database migration scripts
- [ ] Enable Realtime on `driver_locations` table
- [ ] Configure RLS policies
- [ ] Test with real driver app sending location updates
- [ ] Verify phone/SMS permissions on target devices
- [ ] Test on both Android and iOS
- [ ] Monitor Realtime subscription limits
- [ ] Set up location data cleanup job (old records)

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Supabase Realtime enabled
- [ ] Flutter dependencies installed: `flutter pub get`
- [ ] URL Launcher configured for platform-specific setup
- [ ] OpenStreetMap tile usage within terms
- [ ] Firebase Cloud Messaging configured (from previous phase)

---

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Expected Performance
- **Location Update Frequency:** 10-30 seconds
- **Marker Animation Duration:** 800ms
- **ETA Update Interval:** 30 seconds
- **Reconnection Delay:** 5 seconds on failure
- **Map Tile Load Time:** < 2 seconds (network dependent)

### Resource Usage
- **Memory:** Minimal increase (~10-15MB for map tiles)
- **Network:** ~1KB per location update
- **Battery Impact:** Low (leverages existing Realtime connection)

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Current State
1. **Route Display:** Shows straight line, not actual road path
   - **Future Enhancement:** Integrate routing API (Google Directions, Mapbox)

2. **Traffic Data:** Uses static 1.2x traffic factor
   - **Future Enhancement:** Real-time traffic API integration

3. **Offline Mode:** Map requires internet connection
   - **Future Enhancement:** Implement tile caching

### Edge Cases Handled
- ✅ GPS permission denied
- ✅ Location services disabled
- ✅ Network disconnection during tracking
- ✅ Driver location temporarily unavailable
- ✅ Invalid location data received
