## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### State Management Flow
```dart
OrderTrackingProvider
    ├── Subscribes to Supabase Realtime
    ├── Listens to order table changes
    ├── Listens to delivery table changes
    ├── Updates OrderTrackingState
    ├── Triggers NotificationService
    └── Updates UI via StateNotifier
```

### Real-Time Subscription
```dart
realtimeService.subscribeToOrder(orderId)
    → Stream<Map<String, dynamic>>
    → _handleOrderUpdate()
    → state.copyWith(newData)
    → UI rebuilds automatically
```

### Notification Flow
```dart
Status Change Detected
    → _showStatusNotification()
    → NotificationService.showNotification()
    → FCM delivers to device
    → User sees notification
```
