# **Brainstorming: Modern Food Delivery App (Flutter \+ Supabase)**

This document outlines the core features, UI/UX philosophy, technical architecture, and monetization strategies for a modern food delivery application, similar to Uber Eats.

## **1\. Core Philosophy & UI/UX Principles**

The app must feel intuitive, fast, and visually appealing. The goal is to minimize the friction between a user's craving and getting their food delivered.

* **Minimalist & Clean UI:** Uncluttered screens, generous use of white space, and a focus on high-quality food photography.  
* **Intuitive Navigation:** A bottom navigation bar for primary actions (Home, Search, Orders, Profile).  
* **Seamless Onboarding:** Quick sign-up/sign-in with social providers (Google, Apple) and a brief, engaging tutorial on the first launch.  
* **Personalization:** The home screen should feel unique to each user, displaying relevant recommendations, past orders, and local favorites.  
* **Micro-interactions & Animations:** Subtle animations for loading states, button presses, and screen transitions to make the app feel alive and responsive.  
* **Dark Mode:** A must-have for modern applications to enhance user comfort in low-light environments.

## **2\. Key App Features (User-Facing)**

### **Onboarding & Authentication**

* **Splash Screen:** Beautiful, branded entry point.  
* **Social Sign-Up/Sign-In:** Supabase Auth with Google, Apple, and email/password options.  
* **Location Permissions:** A clear and friendly request for location access is crucial for the "near me" functionality. Explain *why* it's needed.

### **Home/Discovery Screen**

* **Interactive Map View:**  
  * The top half of the screen could feature a map (using a package like flutter\_map or Maps\_flutter).  
  * Pins on the map represent restaurants. Tapping a pin shows a small preview card with the restaurant's name, rating, and cuisine type.  
  * A "Recenter" button to bring the map back to the user's current location.  
* **Dynamic List View:**  
  * The bottom half of the screen will be a scrollable list.  
  * **Categories:** Horizontal scrolling list of food categories (e.g., Pizza, Sushi, Burgers, Healthy).  
  * **Carousels:**  
    * "Featured Restaurants"  
    * "New on \[App Name\]"  
    * "Deals Near You"  
    * "Order Again" based on past orders.  
* **Top Search Bar:** A prominent search bar that's always accessible.

### **Search & Filtering**

* **Real-time Search:** As the user types, results for restaurants and menu items should appear instantly.  
* **Advanced Filtering:**  
  * Filter by: Price Range, Rating, Dietary Restrictions (Vegan, Gluten-Free), Delivery Time.  
  * Sort by: Recommended, Most Popular, Rating, Delivery Time.

### **Restaurant Profile Screen**

* **Hero Image:** A stunning, high-resolution photo of the restaurant's best dish.  
* **Essential Info:** Name, address, rating, cuisine type, price range, and estimated delivery time.  
* **Sticky Menu Categories:** As the user scrolls through the menu, the categories (e.g., Appetizers, Main Courses, Drinks) should stick to the top for easy navigation.  
* **Popular Items:** A dedicated section at the top for the restaurant's best-selling items.  
* **Reviews:** A tab or section to view user ratings and reviews.

### **Ordering & Cart**

* **Dish Customization:** A modal pop-up to select options (e.g., size, toppings, spice level).  
* **Floating Cart Button:** A subtle, persistent button showing the number of items in the cart.  
* **Easy Checkout Process:**  
  * Clear summary of items and total cost.  
  * Delivery address selection (with an option to add notes for the driver).  
  * Secure payment integration (Stripe is a great option with Supabase).  
  * Apply promo codes.

### **Live Order Tracking**

* **Real-time Map:** Show the driver's location in real-time from the restaurant to the user's address.  
* **Order Status Updates:** Visual timeline showing "Order Placed," "In the Kitchen," "With Driver," and "Delivered."  
* **Push Notifications:** For key status changes.

### **User Profile**

* **Order History:** A list of past and current orders.  
* **Saved Addresses:** Manage multiple delivery addresses.  
* **Payment Methods:** Add or remove credit/debit cards.  
* **Settings:** Manage notifications and app preferences.

## **3\. Supabase Backend Structure**

Supabase is an excellent choice as it provides a database, authentication, storage, and serverless functions out of the box.

### **Database Tables:**

* **profiles:** (Linked to auth.users)  
  * id (UUID, Primary Key, Foreign Key to auth.users.id)  
  * full\_name (text)  
  * avatar\_url (text)  
  * phone\_number (text)  
* **restaurants:**  
  * id (UUID, Primary Key)  
  * name (text)  
  * address (text)  
  * location (PostGIS point for geographic queries \- ST\_DWithin to find restaurants in a radius)  
  * cuisine\_type (text)  
  * rating (numeric)  
  * hero\_image\_url (text)  
  * owner\_id (UUID, Foreign Key to auth.users.id)  
* **menu\_items:**  
  * id (UUID, Primary Key)  
  * restaurant\_id (UUID, Foreign Key to restaurants.id)  
  * name (text)  
  * description (text)  
  * price (numeric)  
  * image\_url (text)  
  * category (text, e.g., "Appetizer", "Main")  
* **orders:**  
  * id (UUID, Primary Key)  
  * user\_id (UUID, Foreign Key to profiles.id)  
  * restaurant\_id (UUID, Foreign Key to restaurants.id)  
  * status (text, e.g., "placed", "preparing", "out\_for\_delivery", "delivered")  
  * total\_price (numeric)  
  * delivery\_address (text)  
  * created\_at (timestamp)  
* **order\_items:** (Junction table to handle many-to-many relationship between orders and menu items)  
  * id (UUID, Primary Key)  
  * order\_id (UUID, Foreign Key to orders.id)  
  * menu\_item\_id (UUID, Foreign Key to menu\_items.id)  
  * quantity (integer)  
  * customizations (jsonb)

### **Supabase Storage:**

* Use for storing user avatars and restaurant/menu item images. Implement Row Level Security to control access.

### **Supabase Functions (Edge Functions):**

* Handle payment processing with Stripe.  
* Calculate delivery fees.  
* Send push notifications.

## **4\. Flutter App Architecture**

* **State Management:** Riverpod or Bloc are excellent choices for managing complex state in a scalable way. Riverpod is often considered more modern and flexible.  
* **Folder Structure:** Organize the project by feature (e.g., features/authentication, features/home, features/restaurant\_discovery).  
* **Services/Repositories:** Abstract the Supabase data fetching logic into its own layer to keep the UI clean.  
* **Dependency Injection:** Use a locator like get\_it to provide services throughout the app.  
* **Mapping:** Integrate a map provider like Google Maps or OpenStreetMap using Flutter packages. flutter\_map is a great open-source option.

This structure provides a solid foundation for building a feature-rich, modern, and scalable food delivery application.
