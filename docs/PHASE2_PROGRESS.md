- **Tests:** Integration tests will be added in subsequent days
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive setup guide created

#### Next Steps Required
1. Run `flutterfire configure` to generate actual Firebase credentials
2. Apply database migration in Supabase Dashboard
3. Configure Android `google-services.json` and `build.gradle`
