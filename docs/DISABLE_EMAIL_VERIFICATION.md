# Disable Email Verification - Configuration Guide

This document outlines the changes made to disable email verification for user sign-ups in the NandyFood app.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Changes (Flutter)

#### Login Screen (`lib/features/authentication/presentation/screens/login_screen.dart`)
- **Hidden Apple Sign-In Button**: Commented out the Apple sign-in button (lines 465-524) to temporarily disable this feature.
- The Apple sign-in functionality remains in the code but is visually hidden from users.

#### Signup Screen (`lib/features/authentication/presentation/screens/signup_screen.dart`)
- **Updated Success Flow**: Changed the redirect after successful signup from `/auth/verify-email` to `/home`.
- **Updated Success Message**: Changed from "Account created! Please verify your email." to "Account created successfully!"
- Users now go directly to the home screen after signing up.

### 2. Backend Configuration Required

To fully disable email verification, you **MUST** configure your Supabase project:

#### Steps to Disable Email Verification in Supabase:

1. **Log in to Supabase Dashboard**: Go to [https://app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)

2. **Navigate to Your Project**: Select the NandyFood project

3. **Go to Authentication Settings**:
   - Click on **Authentication** in the left sidebar
   - Click on **Providers**
   - Click on **Email** provider

4. **Disable Email Confirmation**:
   - Find the setting **"Confirm email"** or **"Enable email confirmations"**
   - **Toggle it OFF** or set to `disabled`
   - This allows users to sign in immediately without verifying their email

5. **Save Changes**: Click the **Save** button

#### Alternative: Auto-confirm Emails (Development Only)

For development environments, you can also:
1. Go to **Authentication** → **Settings**
2. Look for **"Disable email confirmations"** under Email Settings
3. Enable this option

**⚠️ WARNING**: Disabling email verification in production is not recommended for security reasons. This should primarily be used for:
- Development/testing environments
- MVP/prototype phases
- Controlled user bases

## Testing the Changes

### Test Signup Flow:
1. Launch the app
2. Navigate to the signup screen
3. Enter user details (name, email, password)
4. Click "Create Account"
5. **Expected**: User is immediately redirected to `/home` without email verification
6. **Success Message**: "Account created successfully!"

### Test Login Flow:
1. Navigate to the login screen
2. **Expected**: Apple sign-in button should NOT be visible
3. Only Google sign-in and email/password options should be visible
4. Users can log in immediately after signup without verifying email

## Reverting Changes

### To Re-enable Email Verification:

1. **Frontend**: Update `signup_screen.dart`
   ```dart
   // Change line 54 from:
   context.go('/home');
   // To:
   context.go('/auth/verify-email');
   
   // Change line 49 from:
   content: const Text('Account created successfully!'),
   // To:
   content: const Text('Account created! Please verify your email.'),
   ```

2. **Backend**: In Supabase Dashboard
   - Navigate to Authentication → Providers → Email
   - Toggle "Confirm email" back ON
   - Save changes

### To Re-enable Apple Sign-In:

1. Uncomment lines 465-524 in `login_screen.dart`
2. Remove the comment markers (`//`) from the Apple sign-in button code

## Files Modified

1. `lib/features/authentication/presentation/screens/login_screen.dart`
   - Lines 465-524: Commented out Apple sign-in button

2. `lib/features/authentication/presentation/screens/signup_screen.dart`
   - Line 44: Changed comment from "email verification screen" to "home screen"
   - Line 49: Updated success message
   - Line 54: Changed redirect from `/auth/verify-email` to `/home`

## Additional Notes

- The email verification screen (`verify_email_screen.dart`) is still present in the codebase
- The email verification logic in `auth_provider.dart` (lines 259-277) remains functional
- These can be re-enabled at any time if email verification is needed in the future

## Security Considerations

When email verification is disabled:
- **Risk**: Anyone can create an account with any email address
- **Impact**: Email ownership is not verified
- **Mitigation**: Consider implementing:
  - Rate limiting on signup endpoints
  - CAPTCHA on signup forms
  - Email verification for password reset
  - Secondary verification methods (phone numbers, etc.)
