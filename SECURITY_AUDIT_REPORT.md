## 6. Testing Recommendations

### 6.1 RLS Policy Testing
Test each table with:
1. Unauthenticated user (should fail)
2. Authenticated user accessing own data (should succeed)
3. Authenticated user accessing others' data (should fail)
4. Service role (should have full access)
5. Restaurant owners accessing their data (should succeed)
6. Restaurant owners accessing other restaurants' data (should fail)

### 6.2 Security Testing Tools
- **Supabase Dashboard** - Test RLS in SQL editor
- **Postman** - Test API endpoints with different auth tokens
- **OWASP ZAP** - Automated security scanning
- **Burp Suite** - Manual penetration testing
- **SQLMap** - SQL injection testing (should all fail)

---

## 7. Monitoring & Alerting

### Recommended Alerts
1. **Failed authentication attempts** (>5 in 1 minute)
2. **RLS policy violations** (unauthorized access attempts)
3. **Payment failures** (>5% failure rate)
4. **API error rates** (>1% 500 errors)
5. **Unusual data access patterns** (mass data export)
6. **Service role key usage** (should be minimal)

### Logging Strategy
- Log all authentication events
- Log all payment transactions
- Log RLS policy violations
- Log API errors and failures
- **DO NOT LOG** sensitive data (passwords, card numbers, etc.)

---

## 8. Incident Response Plan

### If Security Breach Detected:
1. **Immediately** revoke compromised credentials
2. **Lock down** affected accounts
3. **Investigate** scope of breach
4. **Notify** affected users (within 72 hours for GDPR)
5. **Patch** vulnerability
6. **Monitor** for further attacks
7. **Document** incident and response

---

## 9. Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. Apply RLS policies to 5 unprotected tables

3. Document service role key usage

### This Week
1. Enable email verification
2. Configure rate limiting
3. Review CORS settings
