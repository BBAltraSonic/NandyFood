# Remediation Plan for tasks.md Issues

## Overview
This document outlines the remediation plan for issues identified during the analysis of the Modern Food Delivery App implementation tasks.

## Issues Identified in tasks.md

### 1. Requirement Traceability (A1)
**Issue**: Need to establish clear mapping between requirements in spec.md and tasks in tasks.md
**Status**: Tasks exist but requirement traceability is not explicitly documented

**Remediation Steps**:
1. Add requirement IDs to each relevant task
2. Create a comprehensive traceability matrix
3. Update task descriptions to reference specific requirements

**Updated Task Format Example**:
```
### T007: Create Authentication UI Components [P]
**Requirement(s)**: FR-001
**Description**: Build authentication screens and widgets to allow users to sign up and sign in with multiple authentication methods (email, Google, Apple)
**Files to create**:

- lib/features/authentication/presentation/screens/login_screen.dart
- lib/features/authentication/presentation/screens/signup_screen.dart
- lib/features/authentication/presentation/screens/profile_screen.dart
**Dependencies**: T004, T05
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 3 hours
```

### 2. Constitution Alignment (D1)
**Issue**: Tasks need clearer alignment with constitution principles
**Status**: Tasks exist but don't explicitly reference constitutional principles

**Remediation Steps**:
1. Add constitution principle references to relevant tasks
2. Ensure each task description reflects constitutional compliance
3. Add specific notes about how tasks meet constitutional requirements

**Enhanced Task Example**:
```

- Ensure error messages are user-friendly with retry options
- Maintain 60 FPS during state transitions
- Follow consistent design system for all state indicators
**Files to modify**:
- All UI screens
- All providers
**Dependencies**: T005, T07-T011
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 4 hours
```

### 3. Edge Case Handling (E1)
**Issue**: Some edge cases from spec.md may not have corresponding tasks
**Status**: Need to create specific tasks for handling identified edge cases

**Remediation Steps**:
1. Create specific tasks for the edge cases mentioned in spec.md
2. Add error handling tasks for restaurant item unavailability
3. Implement cancellation handling for delivery drivers
4. Add location change handling during delivery

**Additional Tasks for Edge Cases**:
```

```

### 4. Performance Metrics Implementation (C1)
**Issue**: Tasks need more explicit performance requirements
**Status**: Some tasks mention performance but need more specific metrics

**Remediation Steps**:
1. Add specific performance requirements to relevant tasks
2. Include performance validation tasks
3. Add performance monitoring implementation tasks

**Performance-Focused Tasks**:
```
### T34: Implement Performance Monitoring

**Status**: Need to standardize terminology across all tasks

**Remediation Steps**:
1. Create consistent terminology for UI components
2. Standardize references to entities across tasks
3. Ensure consistent naming for services and providers

**Terminology Guidelines for Tasks**:
- Use "screen" for Flutter UI screens (e.g., login_screen.dart)
- Use "widget" for reusable UI components
- Use "service" for business logic classes
- Use "provider" for Riverpod state management
- Use "model" for data classes
- Use "repository" for data access layer
- Use "entity" for domain objects

### 6. Task Dependency Corrections

- All tasks include constitution principle alignment
- All edge cases from spec.md have corresponding implementation tasks
- Performance requirements clearly defined in relevant tasks
- Terminology consistent across all tasks
