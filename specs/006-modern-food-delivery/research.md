# Research: Modern Food Delivery App (Flutter + Supabase)

## Decision: Technology Stack Selection
- **Rationale**: Selected Flutter for cross-platform mobile development to target both iOS and Android with a single codebase, reducing development time and maintenance overhead. Supabase chosen as the backend solution for its comprehensive features including authentication, database, storage, and real-time capabilities.
- **Alternatives Considered**: 
  - Native iOS (Swift) + Android (Kotlin) development: Higher development and maintenance costs
  - React Native + Firebase: Firebase has limitations in certain regions and is proprietary
  - Flutter + Firebase: Decided on Supabase for better open-source alignment and PostgreSQL familiarity
  - Flutter + Custom Backend: More development time required

## Decision: State Management Approach
- **Rationale**: Selected Riverpod for state management due to its compile-time safety, scalability, and ease of testing compared to other Flutter state management solutions.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Provider: More verbose setup
  - Bloc/Cubit: Steeper learning curve and more boilerplate
  - MobX: Additional complexity with code generation

## Decision: Map Integration
- **Rationale**: Selected flutter_map for map integration as it provides a free and open-source alternative to Google Maps, avoiding potential costs and privacy concerns.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Google Maps Flutter SDK: Proprietary with potential costs
  - Mapbox: Requires API keys and has usage-based pricing

## Decision: Payment Processing
- **Rationale**: Selected Stripe for payment processing due to its wide acceptance, strong security, and comprehensive feature set including multiple payment methods and fraud protection.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - PayPal: More limited in some regions
  - Razorpay: Regional limitations
  - Custom payment solution: Higher complexity and security requirements

## Decision: Architecture Pattern
- **Rationale**: Feature-based architecture selected to organize code by business features rather than technical layers, improving maintainability and scalability as the app grows.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Layered architecture: Can lead to tight coupling between features
  - Clean architecture: More complexity than needed for this project scope

## Research: Performance Considerations
- Flutter provides good performance with its own rendering engine
- Supabase real-time subscriptions will enable efficient order tracking
- Proper caching strategies will be implemented using Hive or similar for offline capability
- Image optimization will be crucial for app performance and user experience

## Research: Security Considerations
- Supabase provides row-level security (RLS) for fine-grained access control
- Authentication will be implemented using Supabase Auth with support for email, Google, and Apple sign-in
- Payment processing through Stripe Elements for PCI compliance
- Secure storage of sensitive data using Flutter Secure Storage
