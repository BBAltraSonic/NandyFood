## Terminology Usage Guidelines

### 1. Document-Specific Guidelines

#### spec.md Guidelines
- Use "requirement" instead of "req"
- Use "functional requirement" for behavior specifications
- Use "non-functional requirement" for quality attributes
- Use "user story" for user-focused descriptions
- Use "acceptance scenario" for testable conditions

#### plan.md Guidelines
- Use "feature" consistently instead of "module" or "component"
- Use "screen" instead of "page" or "view"
- Use "service" for data access components
- Use "provider" for Riverpod state management
- Use "architecture" for structural decisions

#### tasks.md Guidelines
- Use "task" for implementation activities
- Use "screen" for UI components
- Use "service" for business logic components
- Use "provider" for state management
- Use "model" for data structures

### 2. Code Context Guidelines
- Use "auth" as abbreviation for authentication in code
- Use "UI" as abbreviation for user interface in code
- Use "API" for application programming interface
- Use "DB" for database in technical contexts
- Use "HTTP" for web protocol references
