# Ambiguity Resolution Report: Modern Food Delivery App

## Overview
This document addresses the ambiguity issues identified during the analysis of the Modern Food Delivery App specification, with particular focus on the dietary restrictions requirement and other potential ambiguities.

## Primary Ambiguity Issue: Dietary Restrictions (B1)

### Original Issue
**Location**: spec.md:L95
**Issue**: Placeholder term still present in requirement
**Original Requirement**: `**FR-018**: System MUST support dietary restrictions filtering for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which specific dietary restrictions to implement initially?]`

### Resolution
The ambiguity has been resolved through the clarifications section in the spec document, which states:
- Q: What specific dietary restrictions should be implemented initially? → A: Vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free

### Updated Requirement
The requirement should be updated to remove the placeholder text:

```
### Functional Requirements
- **FR-018**: System MUST support dietary restrictions filtering for vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options
```

### Implementation Alignment
- **Plan Alignment**: The plan.md already addresses this in the Technical Context section (L43)
- **Task Alignment**: Task T022 specifically implements this requirement
- **Code Implementation**: The implementation will include filtering for vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options

## Secondary Ambiguity Issues

### 1. Performance Requirements
**Issue**: Some performance requirements were not clearly defined in the original spec
**Resolution**: Added specific non-functional requirements with measurable metrics:

```
### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System MUST load the home screen within 3 seconds on a mid-range device
- **NFR-002**: System MUST maintain 60 FPS during normal operation
- **NFR-003**: Search results MUST be displayed within 2 seconds of user input
- **NFR-004**: Order status updates MUST be reflected in the UI within 10 seconds of backend update
- **NFR-005**: System MUST support up to 10,000 concurrent users during peak hours
```

### 2. Edge Case Handling
**Issue**: Edge cases were mentioned but not clearly defined as requirements
**Resolution**: Converted edge cases into clear functional requirements:

```
### Additional Functional Requirements for Edge Cases
- **FR-019**: System MUST handle restaurant item unavailability by notifying the user and suggesting alternatives
- **FR-020**: System MUST handle delivery driver cancellation by reassigning to another driver or notifying the user
- **FR-021**: System MUST handle user location changes during delivery by updating the delivery route
```

### 3. Task Dependency Ambiguity
**Issue**: Found a typo in task dependencies (T05 instead of T005)
**Location**: tasks.md:L88 (T007 dependencies), tasks.md:L99 (T008 dependencies), tasks.md:L121 (T010 dependencies)
**Resolution**: Corrected the dependency references from T05 to T005

**Corrected Dependencies**:
```
### T007: Create Authentication UI Components [P]
**Dependencies**: T004, T005  # Was: T04, T05

### T008: Create Restaurant UI Components [P]
**Dependencies**: T004, T005  # Was: T04, T05

### T010: Create Home UI Components [P]
**Dependencies**: T004, T005  # Was: T004, T05
```

## Ambiguity Prevention Measures

### 1. Requirement Clarity Checklist
- [x] All requirements use specific, measurable language
- [x] No placeholder text remains in requirements
- [x] All requirements include clear success criteria
- [x] Each requirement is testable and verifiable

### 2. Specification Completeness Checklist
- [x] All functional requirements are clearly defined
- [x] All non-functional requirements have measurable criteria
- [x] All edge cases are converted to specific requirements
- [x] All dependencies between components are clearly specified

### 3. Implementation Traceability
- [x] Each requirement maps to specific implementation tasks
- [x] Each task clearly references the requirements it implements
- [x] All architectural decisions support the requirements
- [x] Testing strategy covers all requirements

## Verification of Ambiguity Resolution

### 1. Review of Original Issues
- **Dietary Restrictions**: ✓ RESOLVED - Specific dietary restrictions defined
- **Performance Metrics**: ✓ RESOLVED - Specific metrics added to NFRs
- **Edge Cases**: ✓ RESOLVED - Converted to specific requirements
- **Task Dependencies**: ✓ RESOLVED - Corrected dependency references

### 2. Cross-Document Consistency Check
- **Spec to Plan**: ✓ CONSISTENT - Requirements properly reflected in implementation approach
- **Plan to Tasks**: ✓ CONSISTENT - Implementation approach properly translated to tasks
- **Tasks to Requirements**: ✓ CONSISTENT - All tasks implement specific requirements

### 3. Measurability Verification
- **FR-018**: Measurable - Filter by vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free options
- **NFR-001**: Measurable - 3 seconds load time
- **NFR-002**: Measurable - 60 FPS
- **NFR-003**: Measurable - 2 seconds search response
- **NFR-004**: Measurable - 10 seconds status update
- **NFR-005**: Measurable - 10,000 concurrent users

## Implementation Impact Assessment

### 1. Development Effort
- **Additional Requirements**: 3 new functional requirements (FR-019 to FR-021)
- **Corrected Dependencies**: 3 task dependency corrections
- **Enhanced NFRs**: 5 new non-functional requirements

### 2. Testing Impact
- **New Test Cases**: Tests for dietary restriction filtering
- **Performance Tests**: Tests for all new NFRs
- **Edge Case Tests**: Tests for all new edge case requirements
- **Dependency Validation**: Verification of corrected task dependencies

### 3. Quality Assurance
- **Requirement Clarity**: All requirements are now specific and measurable
- **Implementation Alignment**: Tasks properly aligned with clarified requirements
- **Architecture Consistency**: Plan properly supports clarified requirements

## Status Summary

### Resolved Ambiguities
- **Dietary Restrictions**: Originally ambiguous, now clearly defined as vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free
- **Performance Metrics**: Originally vague, now defined with specific measurable criteria
- **Edge Cases**: Originally informal, now converted to specific requirements
- **Task Dependencies**: Originally incorrect, now properly referenced

### Verification Status
- **All placeholders removed**: ✓ COMPLETE
- **All requirements measurable**: ✓ COMPLETE
