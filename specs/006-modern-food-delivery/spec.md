**Feature Branch**: `006-modern-food-delivery`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Modern Food Delivery App (Flutter + Supabase)"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
   ‚Üí Ensure compliance with constitution principles
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
   - Compliance with the Food Delivery App constitution

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a hungry user, I want to quickly find nearby restaurants, browse their menu, place an order, and track its delivery so that I can get food delivered with minimal effort and maximum convenience.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has opened the app, **When** they browse the home screen, **Then** they see a map view of nearby restaurants and a list of featured options.
2. **Given** a user has searched for a specific cuisine type, **When** they select a restaurant, **Then** they can view the menu, customize items, and place an order.
3. **Given** a user has placed an order, **When** they are on the order tracking screen, **Then** they can see the live location of their delivery and estimated arrival time.
4. **Given** a user has completed an order, **When** they return to the app, **Then** they see their order history and can reorder from past favorites.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a restaurant is temporarily out of an item after the user has placed their order?
- How does the system handle a delivery driver cancellation?
- What happens when the user's location changes during delivery?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to search in real-time for restaurants and menu items
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to filter restaurants by price range, rating, dietary restrictions, and delivery time
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to sort results by recommended, popularity, rating and delivery time
- **FR-007**: System MUST display restaurant profiles with essential info, menu, categories, and popular items
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to customize menu items (size, toppings, spice level)
