# Remediation Plan for spec.md Issues

## Overview
This document outlines the remediation plan for issues identified during the analysis of the Modern Food Delivery App specification.

## Issues Identified in spec.md

### 1. Ambiguity Issue (B1)
**Location**: spec.md:L95
**Issue**: Placeholder term still present in requirement
**Current**: `**FR-018**: System MUST support dietary restrictions filtering for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which specific dietary restrictions to implement initially?]`
**Status**: Although the clarifications section addresses this, the requirement still contains a placeholder marker

**Remediation Steps**:
1. Update the requirement to reflect the clarified information
2. Replace placeholder with specific dietary restrictions
3. Ensure all requirements are clear and unambiguous

**Updated Requirement**:
```
- **FR-018**: System MUST support dietary restrictions filtering for vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options
```

### 2. Requirement Traceability (A1)
**Issue**: Similar functionality mentioned in both requirements and tasks without clear mapping
**Status**: Need to establish clear traceability between requirements and tasks

**Remediation Steps**:
1. Create a traceability matrix mapping each requirement to its corresponding tasks
2. Add requirement IDs to relevant tasks in tasks.md
3. Ensure each requirement has at least one corresponding task

**Traceability Matrix Example**:
| Requirement ID | Requirement Description | Corresponding Task(s) | Status |
|----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|---------|
| FR-001 | Authentication | T007, T012 | Complete |
| FR-002 | Location permission | T017 | Complete |
| FR-003 | Map display | T010, T018 | Complete |
| FR-004 | Search functionality | T010 | Complete |
| FR-005 | Filtering | T008, T022 | Complete |
| FR-006 | Sorting | T008 | Complete |
| FR-007 | Restaurant profiles | T008 | Complete |
| FR-008 | Menu customization | T014 | Complete |
| FR-009 | Shopping cart | T009, T014 | Complete |
| FR-010 | Payment processing | T015, T019 | Complete |
| FR-011 | Order tracking | T016, T018 | Complete |
| FR-012 | Order status updates | T016 | Complete |
| FR-013 | Order history | T009, T011 | Complete |
| FR-014 | Address/Payment management | T011 | Complete |
| FR-015 | Dark mode | T021 | Complete |
| FR-016 | Promotion codes | T023 | Complete |
| FR-017 | Push notifications | T020 | Complete |
| FR-018 | Dietary restrictions | T022 | Complete |

### 3. Performance Metrics Specification (C1)
**Issue**: Performance requirements lack specific metrics in some areas
**Status**: Need to add more specific performance requirements

**Remediation Steps**:
1. Add specific performance requirements to the spec.md
2. Include measurable criteria for response times, loading times, and performance standards
3. Define acceptable performance thresholds

**Additional Performance Requirements**:
```
### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System MUST load the home screen within 3 seconds on a mid-range device
- **NFR-002**: System MUST maintain 60 FPS during normal operation
- **NFR-003**: Search results MUST be displayed within 2 seconds of user input
- **NFR-004**: Order status updates MUST be reflected in the UI within 10 seconds of backend update
- **NFR-005**: System MUST support up to 10,000 concurrent users during peak hours
```

### 4. Edge Cases Coverage (E1)
**Issue**: Some edge cases from spec may not have corresponding tasks
**Status**: Need to create specific tasks to handle edge cases

**Remediation Steps**:
1. Create specific tasks for handling edge cases
2. Add error handling requirements for the identified edge cases
3. Ensure all edge cases have corresponding implementation tasks

**Additional Requirements for Edge Cases**:
```
### Additional Functional Requirements for Edge Cases
- **FR-019**: System MUST handle restaurant item unavailability by notifying the user and suggesting alternatives
- **FR-020**: System MUST handle delivery driver cancellation by reassigning to another driver or notifying the user
- **FR-021**: System MUST handle user location changes during delivery by updating the delivery route
```

### 5. Terminology Standardization (F1)
**Issue**: Minor terminology differences between spec and task descriptions
**Status**: Need to standardize terminology across documents

**Remediation Steps**:
1. Create a glossary of terms used in the project
2. Ensure consistent terminology between spec, plan, and tasks
3. Update any inconsistent terms to match the standard definitions

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (Day 1)
1. Update FR-018 to remove placeholder text
2. Add the additional performance requirements to spec.md
3. Add the edge case handling requirements to spec.md

### Phase 2: Traceability Enhancement (Day 2)
1. Create complete traceability matrix
2. Update tasks.md to reference requirement IDs
3. Verify all requirements have corresponding tasks

### Phase 3: Consistency Checks (Day 3)
1. Review terminology across all documents
2. Create and implement standardized glossary
3. Perform final consistency check

## Verification Steps
1. After each phase, verify that the updates align with the constitution principles
2. Ensure all changes maintain the original intent of the specification
3. Confirm that all requirements remain testable and measurable
4. Validate that the updates improve clarity without adding implementation details

## Success Criteria
- All placeholder markers removed from requirements
- Complete traceability matrix established
- Performance requirements clearly defined with measurable criteria
- All edge cases addressed with corresponding tasks
- Terminology consistent across all documents
- All changes compliant with the Food Delivery App constitution
