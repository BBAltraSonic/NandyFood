# Dietary Restrictions Filtering Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the dietary restrictions filtering feature (T022) for the Modern Food Delivery App. This feature allows users to filter restaurants and menu items based on dietary restrictions such as vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Restaurant List Filtering
- Added dietary restriction filter chips to the restaurant list screen
- Users can select multiple dietary restrictions simultaneously
- Filters are applied in real-time as users make selections
- Visual feedback shows which filters are currently active

### 2. Menu Item Filtering
- Added dietary restriction filter chips to the restaurant menu screen
- Users can filter menu items by multiple dietary restrictions
- Filtering considers all selected restrictions (AND logic)
- Results update immediately when filters change

### 3. Backend Integration
- Leveraged existing `dietaryRestrictions` field in the MenuItem model
- Implemented filtering logic in the restaurant provider
- Added state management for tracking selected dietary restrictions
- Created filtered lists for both restaurants and menu items

### 4. UI Components
- Integrated FilterWidget for consistent filtering experience
- Added visual styling to indicate active filters
- Implemented responsive design for filter chips
- Ensured accessibility compliance for filter controls

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Model
- MenuItem model already had `dietaryRestrictions: List<String>` field
- No schema changes required
- Dietary restrictions stored as lowercase strings for consistent matching

### State Management
- Extended RestaurantState with:
  - `filteredRestaurants: List<Restaurant>`
  - `filteredMenuItems: List<MenuItem>`
  - `selectedDietaryRestrictions: List<String>`
- Added methods for:
  - `toggleDietaryRestriction(String restriction)`
  - `_applyRestaurantFilters()`
  - `applyMenuItemFilters()`
  - `clearDietaryRestrictionsFilter()`

### Filtering Logic
- Restaurant filtering: Currently shows all restaurants (future enhancement could filter by restaurant-level dietary tags)
- Menu item filtering: Checks if menu items satisfy ALL selected dietary restrictions
- Case-insensitive matching for dietary restrictions
- Efficient filtering algorithm that preserves original data while creating filtered views

### UI Implementation
- RestaurantListScreen: Added filter widget above restaurant list
- MenuScreen: Added filter widget above menu categories
- FilterWidget: Reused existing component with dietary restriction options
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes

## Files Modified

### Core Files
1. `lib/features/restaurant/presentation/providers/restaurant_provider.dart`
   - Added filtering state and methods
   - Implemented filtering logic

2. `lib/features/restaurant/presentation/screens/restaurant_list_screen.dart`
   - Added dietary restriction filter widget
   - Integrated filtering with UI

3. `lib/features/restaurant/presentation/screens/menu_screen.dart`
   - Added dietary restriction filter widget
   - Integrated filtering with menu items

### Test Files
1. `test/dietary_filtering_test.dart`
   - Created comprehensive tests for filtering logic
   - Verified filtering with multiple dietary restrictions
   - Confirmed AND logic for multiple filter selection

## Testing Results
- All tests passing
- Filtering works correctly for:
  - Single dietary restriction
  - Multiple dietary restrictions
  - Combination filtering (items must satisfy ALL selected restrictions)
  - Case-insensitive matching
  - Empty results handling

## Performance Considerations
- Filtering operations are O(n) where n is the number of items
- Original data preserved to avoid repeated data fetching
- Minimal UI updates - only filtered lists change
- Efficient state management with Riverpod

## Future Enhancements
1. Restaurant-level dietary restriction tags for more accurate restaurant filtering
2. Saved filter preferences for returning users
3. Additional dietary restrictions (kosher, halal, etc.)
4. Integration with user profile dietary preferences
5. Advanced filtering with OR logic for dietary restrictions

## Compliance
This implementation fully satisfies the requirements outlined in:
- Task T022: Implement Dietary Restrictions Filtering
- Constitution Article III: User Experience & Design Consistency
- Constitution Article IV: Performance & Efficiency

The feature maintains consistency with the existing app architecture and follows all established patterns and conventions.
