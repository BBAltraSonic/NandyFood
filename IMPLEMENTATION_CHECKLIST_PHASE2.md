## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

**Problem:** Supabase real-time disconnects  
**Solution:** Implement reconnection logic, handle network state changes, add heartbeat mechanism

### Issue 3: Driver Location Updates Slow
**Problem:** Map marker moves slowly or jumps  
**Solution:** Use marker animation, interpolate between positions, adjust update frequency
