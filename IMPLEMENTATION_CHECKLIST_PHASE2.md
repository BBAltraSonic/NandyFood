## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: FCM Not Receiving Notifications
**Problem:** Push notifications not arriving  
**Solution:** Check FCM token registration, verify server key in Supabase, test with Firebase Console test message

### Issue 2: Real-Time Connection Drops
**Problem:** Supabase real-time disconnects  
**Solution:** Implement reconnection logic, handle network state changes, add heartbeat mechanism

### Issue 3: Driver Location Updates Slow
**Problem:** Map marker moves slowly or jumps  
**Solution:** Use marker animation, interpolate between positions, adjust update frequency

### Issue 4: Image Upload Fails
**Problem:** Avatar upload times out or fails  
**Solution:** Compress images before upload, implement chunked upload for large files, add retry logic

### Issue 5: Analytics Not Tracking
**Problem:** Events not showing in dashboard  
**Solution:** Check Firebase configuration, verify event names match schema, test in debug mode

-- 3. Set up RLS policies
ALTER TABLE user_favorites ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE saved_carts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE reviews ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Users can manage their own favorites
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own favorites" ON user_favorites
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can manage their own saved carts
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own carts" ON saved_carts
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Reviews are public to read, users manage own
CREATE POLICY "Reviews are public" ON reviews
  FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own reviews" ON reviews
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own reviews" ON reviews
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

## 💡 Pro Tips for Implementation

### Development Best Practices
1. **Test as you build** - Don't wait until the end to test features
2. **Commit frequently** - Small, focused commits with clear messages
3. **Use feature branches** - One branch per major feature
4. **Physical device testing** - Always test notifications and maps on real devices
5. **Firebase emulator** - Use local emulator for testing before deploying

### Performance Optimization
1. **Pagination** - Load reviews, favorites, and order history in pages
2. **Caching** - Cache frequently accessed data (favorites, user profile)
3. **Image optimization** - Compress images before upload
4. **Lazy loading** - Load widgets only when needed
5. **Debouncing** - Debounce search and filter inputs

### Code Quality
1. **Type safety** - Use strong typing for all models
2. **Error handling** - Handle all error cases gracefully
3. **Loading states** - Show appropriate loading indicators
4. **Empty states** - Provide helpful empty state messages
5. **Accessibility** - Add semantic labels for screen readers
