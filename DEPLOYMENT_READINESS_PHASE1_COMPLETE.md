# Deployment Readiness - Phase 1 Complete
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Environment Configuration & Security Audit Complete

---

## Summary

Phase 1 of Deployment Readiness has been completed, covering Environment Configuration and Security Audit. Critical security vulnerabilities have been identified and fixed.

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Environment Configuration Audit
- ✅ Audited current `.env` configuration
- ✅ Identified missing production variables
- ✅ Created `.env.staging.template` for staging environment
- ✅ Created `.env.production.template` for production environment
- ✅ Documented all required environment variables
- ✅ Verified feature flags system is operational
- ✅ Generated comprehensive environment configuration report

**Key Findings:**
- Current setup uses Supabase (configured) and Paystack (test keys)
- Code references PayFast but .env uses Paystack (mismatch identified)
- No hardcoded secrets found in source code
- Environment-based configuration properly implemented
- Feature flags system ready for gradual rollout

### 2. Security Audit
- ✅ Verified Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all tables
- ✅ Fixed 5 tables missing RLS protection (CRITICAL)
- ✅ Scanned codebase for exposed secrets (none found)
- ✅ Audited payment security implementation
- ✅ Verified Firebase configuration
- ✅ Applied RLS migration to production database
- ✅ Generated comprehensive security audit report

**Critical Fixes Applied:**
1. **restaurant_staff** - Added 3 RLS policies
2. **restaurant_owners** - Added 3 RLS policies
3. **user_roles** - Added 2 RLS policies
4. **restaurant_analytics** - Added 2 RLS policies
5. **menu_item_analytics** - Added 2 RLS policies

**Result:** All 20 public tables now have RLS enabled ✅

## ⚠️ Blockers Identified

### Critical (Must Resolve Before Production)
1. **Payment Gateway Mismatch**
   - Code implements PayFast (South African)
   - .env configured with Paystack (Nigerian)
   - **Decision Required:** Choose one gateway and update accordingly

### High Priority
2. **iOS Firebase Configuration**
   - Missing `GoogleService-Info.plist` in iOS/Runner
   - Required for Firebase services on iOS

3. **Production Environment Variables**
   - Need live payment gateway credentials
   - Need Google Maps API key for production
   - Need Sentry DSN for error tracking

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

#### 1. Resolve Payment Gateway Decision
**Option A: Use Paystack**
- Update `Config.dart` to use Paystack keys from .env
- Create or update `PaystackService` class
- Update payment UI to reference Paystack
- Test with Paystack test keys
- **Timeline:** 2-4 hours

**Option B: Use PayFast**
- Get PayFast merchant credentials
- Update .env with PayFast keys
- Test with PayFast sandbox
- Verify webhook integration
- **Timeline:** 3-5 hours (includes signup)

#### 2. Test RLS Policies
- Create test users with different roles
- Verify users can only access their own data
- Test restaurant owner permissions
- Test service role access
- **Timeline:** 2-3 hours

#### 3. Setup Staging Environment
- Create staging Supabase project (or use branches)
- Configure `.env.staging` file
- Deploy to staging
- Test complete flow
- **Timeline:** 3-4 hours
