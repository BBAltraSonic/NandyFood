- ✅ **Expiry Date Validation** - Future date verification
- ✅ **CVC Validation** - Length and format validation
- ✅ **Input Sanitization** - XSS and injection attack prevention
- ⚠️ **Extreme Value Protection** - Some edge cases need attention

### Performance Benchmarks
- ✅ **Card Validation:** <1ms per validation
- ✅ **Method Retrieval:** <1ms per retrieval
- ✅ **Configuration Loading:** <100ms startup time
- ✅ **Batch Processing:** 1000+ validations in <1 second

## Configuration Status

```yaml
Current Configuration:
  cash_on_delivery: true ✅
  payfast: true ✅
  payfast_sandbox: true ✅
  card_payment: false ⚠️
  digital_wallet: false ⚠️
  min_order_amount: 10.0 ✅
  max_cash_amount: 5000.0 ✅
  environment: development ✅
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Security Validation** - Address the failing payment amount security test
2. **Enable Card Payments** - Consider enabling card payment methods in production
3. **Add More Edge Cases** - Additional security validation for extreme scenarios

### Medium Term Improvements
1. **Add Digital Wallet Support** - Implement Apple Pay, Google Pay integration
2. **Enhanced Monitoring** - Add real-time payment success/failure tracking
3. **A/B Testing** - Test different payment flows for optimization

### Long Term Considerations
1. **Multi-Currency Support** - Prepare for international expansion
2. **Subscription Payments** - Consider for premium features
3. **Fraud Detection** - Implement advanced fraud prevention algorithms
