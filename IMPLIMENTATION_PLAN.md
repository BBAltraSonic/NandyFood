\#\#\# 4\. UI/UX & Design System

\- \*\*Theme Management:\*\* ✅ \*\*Excellent\*\*. Comprehensive Material 3 light and dark themes.  
\- \*\*UI Components:\*\* ✅ \*\*Well-Implemented\*\*. Consistent forms, cards, and indicators. Needs empty state illustrations.  
\- \*\*Navigation:\*\* ✅ \*\*Good\*\*. Clear \`GoRouter\` structure with route guards. Missing deep linking and transition animations.  
\- \*\*Accessibility:\*\* ⚠️ \*\*Partially Implemented\*\*. Basic semantic labels exist, but comprehensive testing and features like font scaling are missing.

\---

\#\#\# 5\. Data Flow & Backend Integration

\- \*\*Database Architecture (Supabase):\*\* ✅ \*\*Well-Designed\*\*. Includes tables for users, restaurants, orders, etc., with RLS policies implemented.  
\- \*\*Backend Service Layer:\*\* ✅ \*\*Good\*\*. Centralized services for Database, Auth, Payment, etc. Some \`print\` statements need removal.

\---

\#\#\# 6\. Code Quality & Security

\- \*\*\`flutter analyze\` Results:\*\* ⚠️ \*\*Medium Severity\*\*. 4 errors and 5+ warnings need immediate attention, primarily related to type safety and dead code.  
\- \*\*Code Organization:\*\* ✅ \*\*Good\*\*. Follows a feature-based structure with consistent naming conventions. Some large files and hardcoded strings should be refactored.  
\- \*\*Documentation:\*\* ⚠️ \*\*Minimal\*\*. A \`README.md\` and basic guides exist, but code comments, ADRs, and API documentation are missing.  
\- \*\*Security:\*\* ✅ \*\*Good Foundation\*\*. Implements secure storage, certificate pinning infrastructure, and input validation. However, certificate pinning is not fully connected, and some \`print\` statements leak sensitive data.

\---

\#\#\# 7\. Testing Framework

\- \*\*Overall Coverage:\*\* \~60% estimated.  
\- \*\*Unit & Widget Tests:\*\* ✅ \*\*Good\*\*. Covers critical business logic and all major screens.  
\- \*\*Integration Tests:\*\* ✅ \*\*Good\*\*. Tests key user flows like authentication and placing an order.  
\- \*\*Infrastructure:\*\* ✅ \*\*Excellent\*\*. Well-organized test structure with mock data generators and test runners.
