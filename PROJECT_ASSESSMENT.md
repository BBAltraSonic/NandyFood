- Sticky menu categories during scroll
- Hero images for restaurants
- Floating cart button (PRD requirement)
- Advanced checkout workflow

**Impact:** Incomplete ordering flow, user frustration

### 4. Revenue Generation System ‚ùå
**Current:** Cash-only payment system  
**Missing:**
- Payment gateway integration (Paystack/Stripe)
- Saved payment methods
- Tip selection UI
- Order confirmation flow

**Impact:** No revenue capability - business-critical blocker

### 5. Real-Time Experience ‚ùå
**Current:** Static order status  
**Missing:**

## Security Assessment

### Current Security Measures ‚úÖ
- Supabase Row Level Security policies implemented
- JWT-based authentication with session management
- Environment variable configuration
- Basic input validation in services

### Security Gaps üî¥ Critical
1. **No Certificate Pinning** - Network traffic vulnerable to interception
2. **Missing Token Refresh Logic** - Authentication sessions may expire unexpectedly
3. **Insufficient Input Validation** - All user inputs need validation
4. **No Secure Local Storage** - Sensitive data stored without encryption
5. **Missing Rate Limiting** - API vulnerable to abuse
6. **No Image Upload Validation** - Storage system vulnerable to malicious uploads

---

## UX Assessment

### Current UX State ‚ùå Basic
- Static interfaces with minimal interaction
- Basic loading states only
- No micro-interactions or animations
- Generic error handling
- No accessibility considerations

### UX Priority Improvements
1. **Micro-Interactions** - Button animations, haptic feedback
2. **Loading States** - Shimmer effects and skeleton loaders
3. **Error Handling** - Friendly error messages and recovery options
4. **Accessibility** - Screen reader support, font scaling
5. **Responsive Design** - Tablet and landscape support
6. **Visual Polish** - Custom illustrations and branded elements

---

## Technical Debt

### Architecture Improvements Needed
1. **Repository Pattern** - All data access should be abstracted
2. **Domain Layer** - Business logic separation needed
3. **Dependency Injection** - Implement get_it for better testability
4. **Clean Architecture** - Follow proper layer separation principles

### Code Quality Issues
1. **Error Handling** - Global error handling strategy missing
2. **Logging** - Inconsistent logging practices
3. **Testing Coverage** - Only ~25% test coverage estimated
